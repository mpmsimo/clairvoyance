Modules that are intended to be used are documented below.
- [tfvar](https://github.com/shihanng/tfvar) - programatic definition and generation of variables based on user input
- [hclwrite](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/tree/v2.0.0/hclwrite) - write HCL on the fly
- [terraform-exec](https://github.com/kmoe/terraform-exec) - so we can init/plan/apply via the Terraform CLI programmatically.
- [terrafmt](https://github.com/terrycain/terrafmt) - format the HCL output, if live update is used
